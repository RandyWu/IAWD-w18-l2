Practical Mid Term W2018
-------------------------

1 . scp randywu.txt wu000218@10.50.11.32:/home/wu000218

2. passwd

3. ls - la  OR ls -las

4. ls -la > mt.txt

5. -rw-r--r-- 1 wu000218 wu000218   18 Mar 12 11:45 randywu.txt

6. pwd

7. chown wu000218:cst8254 randywu.txt

8. I was not able to change the group ownership of randywu.txt because I was not apart of the group cst8254.
   Hence I cannot change the group of the file to a group I do no belong too.

   Here is the command to create the new group and add a user to the group:
   groupadd cst8254
   usermod -a -G cst8254 wu000218

   The command went through because I was the owner of the randywu.txt and part of the group
   So I was able to change the permissions.

9. mkdir midtermExam

10. drwxr-xr-x  2 wu000218 wu000218 4096 Mar 12 11:55 midtermExam

11. netstat -at

12. netstat -at > mt2.txt

13. sftp wu000218@10.50.11.32

14. put midtermlaptop.txt

15. The pwd>mt.txt;tree -l>>mt.txt command puts the output of pwd (the present working directory)
    into a file called mt.txt, then tree -l shows the file hierachy of the pwd and the number of
    files and directories, and then appends it to mt.txt.
